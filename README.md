A command-line tool for data compression, written as a data structures and algorithms lab project during Christmas Break 2017-18.

Project Concept
===============

A CLI tool for compressing and decompressing various types of files,
written in Java. My first step will be to implement something fairly
straightforward, like a basic LZW implementation. After that I will add
other algorithms, refine the existing ones and perhaps try to create
specialized algorithms for different types of files, such as images and
audio. The tool will most likely stick to lossless compression.
